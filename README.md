# Weather Dashboard App
This is a web application that allows users to search for the current weather forecast and the 5-day forecast of a particular city using the OpenWeather API. It also saves the search results into a div so that the user can click on it later to display previous cities they have searched.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using the command git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-dashboard.git
Navigate to the project directory using cd weather-dashboard

## Usage
Obtained an API key from OpenWeather and set it as the value for the apiKey variable in the script2.js file.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Type in the name of the city you want to search in the search bar and click the search button.
The current weather forecast and the 5-day forecast for the searched city will be displayed.
The searched city will be saved in the search history div so that the user can click on it later to display previous cities they have searched.
